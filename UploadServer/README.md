# UploadServer

It is a study for ASP.NET Core
upload file: [Uploading Files in Razor Pages](http://www.hishambinateya.com/uploading-files-in-razor-pages).
It is necessary to create a `Uploads` folder in wwwroot folder.

ASP.NET core 2.1 let Razor Pages support ResponseCaching, I also add EasyCaching.ResponseCaching
to test it.
